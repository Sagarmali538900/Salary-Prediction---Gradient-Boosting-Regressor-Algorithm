# Salary-Prediction---Gradient-Boosting-Regressor-Algorithm
This project uses a Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict salary based on experience or other numerical features.

## 📌 What This Notebook Does

* Loads and explores salary dataset
* Preprocesses and selects numerical features
* Trains a Gradient Boosting Regression model
* Evaluates model performance (R², MAE, etc.)
* Visualizes predictions vs actual values

---

## 📁 Files

* `Gardient boosting regressor_salary_data.ipynb` — main regression workflow
* Salary dataset (CSV) — required

---

## 🔧 Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
jupyter notebook "Gardient boosting regressor_salary_data.ipynb"
```

Place the salary dataset in the same folder or update the file path.
